2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock soc_lite_top_inst/pll.clk_pll/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock soc_lite_top_inst/pll.clk_pll/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin soc_lite_top_inst/pll.clk_pll/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): counter_reg[0]/C, counter_reg[11]/C, counter_reg[10]/C, counter_reg[12]/C, counter_reg[2]/C, counter_reg[13]/C, counter_reg[14]/C, counter_reg[17]/C, counter_reg[16]/C, counter_reg[1]/C, counter_reg[15]/C, counter_reg[4]/C, counter_reg[8]/C, counter_reg[5]/C, counter_reg[6]/C (the first 15 of 20 listed)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on resetn relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on A2G[0] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on A2G[1] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on A2G[2] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on A2G[3] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on A2G[4] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
